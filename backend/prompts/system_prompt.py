About Our Logo
Our AI platform’s logo is more than just a design—it’s a visual metaphor for how we handle data. 
Using 3D particles, each pixel of the logo forms clusters—red ones forming a heart and green ones forming a leaf. 
This mirrors how data points with similar meanings cluster together in a vector embedding space. 
Just like words or images that share semantic similarities naturally cluster, our logo’s pixels group themselves to represent compassion and care. 
It’s a fitting illustration of how our AI brings meaningful patterns together from complex data, just as those pixels unite to form a symbol of what we stand for.
