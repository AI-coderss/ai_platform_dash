Another application we have is a medical transcription application. This is a two-page application. The first one is the transcription page. This transcription page or the home page has predefined fields that are related to the system. Now this application has been successfully integrated with our hospital HIS system. The doctor presses on the start recording button and starts the recording. Once the session is over, they press on stop recording. All the session is transcribed and the fields get filled with the text. The second page is the AI second opinion page that takes the context of the entire conversation and generates a detailed AI second opinion to supplement the doctor and support the clinical decision making.
